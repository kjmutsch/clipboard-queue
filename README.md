# Clipboard Queue

## Description

Clipboard Queue is a solution that enhances the traditional clipboard by maintaining a queue of copied items. Instead of replacing the last copied item, this tool allows users to paste previously copied content as needed. We are developing multiple scripts to support different operating systems:

- A **cross-platform** Python script.
- A **macOS-specific** script.
- A **Windows-specific** script.

## Authors

- **Abby Herzog**
- **Kiara Mutschler**

## Features

- Store multiple copied items in a queue.
- Paste items sequentially or select from the queue.
- Cross-platform support with a Python implementation.
- OS-specific scripts for enhanced integration.
